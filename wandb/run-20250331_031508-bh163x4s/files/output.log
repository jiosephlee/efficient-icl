-------------------- Question:
A concert ticket costs $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all?
Answer:
476
Response:
<think>
First, calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets: 10 tickets * $40/ticket = $400.
For the remaining 2 tickets, calculate the discount: 5% of $40 = $40 * 0.05 = $2 discount per ticket.
Thus, the cost of each of the remaining tickets is $40 - $2 = $38.
The total cost for the remaining 2 tickets is 2 * $38 = $76.
Adding the cost of the first 10 tickets and the remaining 2 tickets: $400 + $76 = $476.
So, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476.

-------------------- Question:
Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer?
Answer:
1500
Response:
<think>
First, determine the total number of payments over 20 years for both the house and the trailer. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of payments is 20 * 12 = 240 payments.

Next, assume the interest rate is the same for both loans, as the problem does not specify varying interest rates. The monthly payment can be calculated using the formula for an amortizing loan:

\[ M = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]

where:
- \( M \) is the monthly payment,
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount,
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate, and
- \( n \) is the total number of payments.

However, since the problem doesn't provide the interest rate, we can simplify the comparison by assuming the same interest rate and focusing on the principal amounts directly.

1. Calculate the total monthly payment for the house:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment for House} = \frac{480,000}{240} \]

2. Calculate the total monthly payment for the trailer:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment for Trailer} = \frac{120,000}{240} \]

3. Subtract the monthly payment for the trailer from the monthly payment for the house to find the difference:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Monthly Payment for House} - \text{Monthly Payment for Trailer} \]

Let's perform the calculations:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment for House} = \frac{480,000}{240} = 2000 \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment for Trailer} = \frac{120,000}{240} = 500 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 2000 - 500 = 1500 \]

</think>
<answer>
The monthly payment on the house is $1500 more than the monthly payment on the trailer.

Janet pays $40/hour for 3 hours per week of clarinet lessons and $28/hour for 5 hours a week of piano lessons. How much more does she spend on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year?
Answer:
1040
Response:
<think>
First find the weekly cost of clarinet lessons: $40/hour * 3 hours/week = $120/week
Then find the weekly cost of piano lessons: $28/hour * 5 hours/week = $140/week
Then find the difference in weekly costs: $140/week - $120/week = $20/week
Then convert that weekly difference to a yearly difference: $20/week * 52 weeks/year = $1040/year

-------------------- Question:
Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need?
Answer:
29
Response:
<think>
If Sabrina needs 12 basil leaves, and that is twice as many as sage leaves, then she needs 12 / 2 = 6 sage leaves. She needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves, which means she needs 6 + 5 = 11 verbena leaves. Adding up all the leaves, she needs 12 + 6 + 11 = 29 leaves total.

-------------------- Question:
Over the past five years, on July 4th, the high temperature for Washington, DC has been: 90 degrees in 2020, 90 degrees in 2019, 90 degrees in 2018, 79 degrees in 2017 and 71 degrees in 2016. What is the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years?
Answer:
84
Response:
<think>
To find the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past five years, I need to add up all the recorded temperatures and then divide by the number of years.

The temperatures for each year are:
2020: 90 degrees
2019: 90 degrees
2018: 90 degrees
2017: 79 degrees
2016: 71 degrees

Step 1: Add up the temperatures.
Total temperature = 90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 410 degrees

Step 2: Divide the total temperature by the number of years.
Average temperature = Total temperature / Number of years = 410 / 5 = 82 degrees
</think>
<answer>
The average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past five years is 82 degrees.

-------------------- Question:
Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes. Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes and Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. If they have been reading for 240 minutes now, how many pages have they finished reading in total?
Answer:
328
Response:
<think>
First, determine the reading rate for each person in pages per minute:
- Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes, so her rate is 30/60 = 0.5 pages per minute.
- Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes, so her rate is 27/60 = 0.45 pages per minute.
- Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes, so her rate is 25/60 = 0.4167 (approximately) pages per minute.

Next, find out how many pages each person reads in 240 minutes:
- Rene reads 0.5 pages/minute * 240 minutes = 120 pages.
- Lulu reads 0.45 pages/minute * 240 minutes = 108 pages.
- Cherry reads 0.4167 pages/minute * 240 minutes = 100 pages (approximately).

Finally, add the total pages read by each person to find the total number of pages read:
120 (Rene) + 108 (Lulu) + 100 (Cherry) = 328 pages.

-------------------- Question:
Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell?
Answer:
36
Response:
<think>
Let's denote the number of times Martin rings the big bell as \( B \).

The number of times he rings the small bell would then be \( \frac{1}{3} B + 4 \).

Given that the total number of times he rings both bells combined is 52, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ B + \left( \frac{1}{3} B + 4 \right) = 52 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + \frac{1}{3} B + 4 = 52 \]

Combine the terms involving \( B \):
\[ B + \frac{1}{3} B = 52 - 4 \]
\[ B + \frac{1}{3} B = 48 \]

To combine these, convert \( B \) to \( \frac{3}{3} B \):
\[ \frac{3}{3} B + \frac{1}{3} B = 48 \]
\[ \frac{4}{3} B = 48 \]

Now, solve for \( B \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
\[ B = 48 \times \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ B = 36 \]

So, Martin rings the big bell 36 times.

-------------------- Question:
Bert fills out the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper every day. He uses up a pencil to fill out the puzzles every two weeks. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. How many words are in each crossword puzzle on average?
Answer:
75
Response:
<think>
Bert uses up a pencil every 14 days because there are 2 weeks in 14 days.
He completes crossword puzzles every day, so in 14 days, he completes 14 puzzles.
If it takes 1050 words to use up a pencil in 14 days, then to find the average number of words per puzzle, we divide the total number of words by the number of puzzles, which is 1050 / 14 = <<1050/14=75>>75.

-------------------- Question:
Matt can make a batch of a dozen cookies using 2 pounds of flour.  He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left?
Answer:
105
Response:
<think>
First, we determine the total number of cookies Matt can make. Since 2 pounds of flour make a dozen (12) cookies, 5 pounds of flour would make \(\frac{12}{2} \times 5 = 30\) cookies. With 4 bags of 5 pounds each, he has \(4 \times 5 = 20\) pounds of flour, thus he can make \(\frac{12}{2} \times 20 = 120\) cookies in total.

If Jim eats 15 cookies, the number of cookies left is \(120 - 15 = 105\).

-------------------- Question:
James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?
Answer:
50
Response:
<think>
On the second day, James collects 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day. Since he collected 50 tins on the first day, on the second day he collects 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 tins.

On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than he did on the second day, so he collects 150 - 50 = <<150-50=100>>100 tins.

Now, let's calculate the total from the first three days: 50 (first day) + 150 (second day) + 100 (third day) = <<50+150+100=300>>300 tins.

James aims to collect 500 tins in a week. Therefore, the remaining number of tins he needs to collect over the remaining four days is 500 - 300 = <<500-300=200>>200 tins.

Since he collects an equal number of tins each day for the remaining four days, the number of tins he collects each day is 200 / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 tins.

A jar of jellybeans has 14 blue jellybeans, 26 purple jellybeans and 40 orange jellybeans. If there are 200 jellybeans in the jar, how many are there of the red color?
Answer:
120
Response:
<think>
First, add up the number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans: 14 + 26 + 40 = 80. From the total number of jellybeans, subtract the number of jellybeans that are not red: 200 - 80 = 120.

-------------------- Question:
Five adults and two children go to see a movie and buy $12 worth of concessions. The total cost of their trip is $76. If each child's ticket is $7, how much, in dollars, are the adult tickets?
Answer:
10
Response:
<think>
First, we calculate the total cost of the concessions and tickets. The total cost is $76 and they spent $12 on concessions, leaving $76 - $12 = $64 for tickets.

We know each child's ticket is $7, so two children's tickets cost 2 * $7 = $14.

The total ticket cost is $64, and we subtract the cost of the children's tickets, leaving $64 - $14 = $50 for the adult tickets.

Since there are five adults, we divide the remaining ticket cost by the number of adults to find the cost per adult ticket. $50 / 5 = $10.

Therefore, each adult ticket costs $10.

-------------------- Question:
Janelle had 26 green marbles. Then she bought 6 bags of blue marbles. There were 10 marbles in each bag.  She created a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles and gave it to a friend. How many marbles does Janelle have now?
Answer:
72
Response:
<think>
First, calculate the total number of blue marbles Janelle bought: 6 bags * 10 marbles/bag = 60 blue marbles.
Then, calculate the total number of green and blue marbles before giving the gift: 26 green marbles + 60 blue marbles = 86 marbles.
After giving the gift, Janelle has: 26 - 6 green marbles + 60 - 8 blue marbles = 20 green marbles + 52 blue marbles = 72 marbles.

-------------------- Question:
An old pirate wants to leave his treasure on an island. He has 3500 gold coins. He wants to spread this equally across 5 chests. Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?
Answer:
1000
Response:
<think>
First, let's break down the distribution of each type of coin.

Gold Coins:
- Total gold coins = 3500
- Number of chests = 5
- Gold coins per chest = 3500 / 5 = 700

Silver Coins:
- Total silver coins = 500
- Number of chests = 5
- Silver coins per chest = 500 / 5 = 100

Bronze Coins:
- Total bronze coins = 2 * 500 = 1000
- Number of chests = 5
- Bronze coins per chest = 1000 / 5 = 200

Total Coins per Chest:
- Gold coins per chest + Silver coins per chest + Bronze coins per chest
- 700 + 100 + 200 = 1000

-------------------- Question:
Zach baked cookies for a bake sale. On Monday he baked 32 cookies. On Tuesday he ran out of sugar and could only bake half of the number of cookies he baked the day before. On Wednesday he baked three times the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, but his brother ate 4 of those cookies. How many cookies did he have at the end of the three days?
Answer:
92
Response:
<think>
On Tuesday, Zach baked half the amount of cookies from Monday, so he baked 32 / 2 = <<32/2=16>>16 cookies.
On Wednesday, he baked three times the amount from Tuesday, thus 16 * 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 cookies.
However, his brother ate 4 of those, leaving him with 48 - 4 = <<48-4=44>>44 cookies from Wednesday.
Adding the cookies from all three days, Zach had 32 (Monday) + 16 (Tuesday) + 44 (Wednesday) = <<32+16+44=92>>92 cookies.

-------------------- Question:
Mark and James need a total of 14 dice that are 12 sided to play their game.  Mark has a bag of 10 dice and 60% of them are 12 sided.  James has a bag of 8 dice and 75% of them are 12 sided.  How many dice will the boys need to buy to play their game?
Answer:
2
Response:
<think>
First, we need to find out how many 12-sided dice Mark has. Mark has 10 dice in total and 60% of them are 12-sided, so he has 10 * 0.60 = 6 12-sided dice.

Next, we need to find out how many 12-sided dice James has. James has 8 dice in total and 75% of them are 12-sided, so he has 8 * 0.75 = 6 12-sided dice.

Together, Mark and James have 6 + 6 = 12 12-sided dice.

They need a total of 14 dice to play their game, so they will need to buy 14 - 12 = 2 more 12-sided dice.

-------------------- Question:
Erin counts six trolls hiding by the path in the forest, 6 less than four times that number of trolls hiding under the bridge, and half as many trolls hiding in the plains as under the bridge. How many trolls did she count in total?
Answer:
33
Response:
<think>
First, let's find the number of trolls hiding under the bridge. If Erin counts six trolls by the path and this is 6 less than four times the number hiding under the bridge, we can set up the equation: 6 = 4x - 6, where x is the number of trolls under the bridge. Solving for x, we get 4x = 12, which gives us x = 3.

Next, we know that there are half as many trolls in the plains as under the bridge. So, the number of trolls in the plains is 3 / 2 = 1.5. Since the number of trolls must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 1.

Now, adding up all the trolls, we have 6 by the path, 3 under the bridge, and 1 in the plains. In total, Erin counted 6 + 3 + 1 = <<6+3+1=10>>10 trolls.

-------------------- Question:
Karen packs peanut butter sandwiches in her daughter's lunch 2 randomly chosen days of the week. The other 3 school days, she packs a ham sandwich. She packs a piece of cake on one randomly chosen day and cookies the other four days. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day?
Answer:
12
Response:
<think>
First, we determine the probability of packing a ham sandwich, which is 3 out of 5 days since Karen packs peanut butter sandwiches on 2 randomly chosen days. So, the probability of packing a ham sandwich is \( \frac{3}{5} \).

Next, for the cake, Karen packs it on 1 out of every 5 days, as she chooses one day randomly to pack a piece of cake. The probability of packing cake is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

Since these two events (packing a ham sandwich and packing a piece of cake) are independent of each other, we can find the combined probability by multiplying the individual probabilities together:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{3}{25} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{3}{25} \times 100 = 12\% \]

-------------------- Question:
A four-layer pyramid is being built with each layer having three times as many sandstone blocks as the layer above it. The top layer is a single block. How many sandstone blocks are in the pyramid?
Answer:
40
Response:
<think>
The top layer is 1 block. The second layer will have 3 times as many blocks as the top layer, so it will have 1 * 3 = 3 blocks. The third layer will have 3 times the number of blocks as the second layer, which is 3 * 3 = 9 blocks. The fourth and bottom layer will have 3 times the number of blocks as the third, which is 9 * 3 = 27 blocks.

To find the total number of blocks in the pyramid, we add up the blocks in each layer: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 blocks.

-------------------- Question:
The cost of Joe's new HVAC system is $20,000.  It includes 2 conditioning zones, each with 5 vents.  In dollars, what is the cost of the system per vent?
Answer:
2,000
Response:
<think>
First, we need to determine the total number of vents in the HVAC system. Since there are 2 conditioning zones and each zone has 5 vents, the total number of vents is 2 * 5 = 10. The total cost of the system is $20,000. To find the cost per vent, we divide the total cost by the number of vents. So, the cost per vent is $20,000 / 10 = $2,000.

Lee had $10 and his friend had $8. They went to a restaurant where they ordered chicken wings for $6 and a chicken salad for $4. They also got 2 sodas for $1.00 each. The tax came to $3. How much change should they have received in total?
Answer:
3
Response:
<think>
The total cost of the meal is $6 (chicken wings) + $4 (chicken salad) + $2 (2 sodas at $1 each) + $3 (tax) = $15.
Lee and his friend had a total of $10 + $8 = $18.
Subtracting the total cost of the meal from their total money, they should have received $18 - $15 = $3 in change.

-------------------- Question:
Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?
Answer:
40
Response:
<think>
First, we need to figure out how much of the 140 meters Andy has already walked. Andy walks to school and then back to the house, which is a total of 50 meters to the school and 50 meters back, accounting for 100 meters in total so far.

The remaining distance from the house to the market is part of the total distance walked. Since the total distance walked is 140 meters, and 100 meters of that is accounted for, we can find the distance to the market by subtracting the 100 meters from the total.

The distance to the market can be calculated as such:
140 meters (total distance) - 100 meters (distance to and from school) = 40 meters.

So, the distance between the house and the market is 40 meters.

-------------------- Question:
Tara has been planning to buy a laptop which costs $1000. A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?
Answer:
520
Response:
<think>
First, we calculate the down payment required, which is 20% of the total cost of the laptop: $1000 * 20% = $200. Tara decides to pay an additional $20, so her total down payment is $200 + $20 = $220. This means her remaining balance is $1000 - $220 = $780. Tara then makes monthly payments of $65 for 4 months, so she pays a total of $65 * 4 = $260 in installments. Therefore, her balance after 4 months will be $780 - $260 = $520.

-------------------- Question:
Bill picked 50 apples from the orchard with his wife and two children.  He sends each of his kids to school with 3 apples for their two favorite teachers.  His wife Jill bakes two apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. How many apples does Bill have left?
Answer:
24
Response:
<think>
First, calculate the total number of apples given to the kids for school. Since each child takes 3 apples and there are 2 children, the total apples given to the kids is 3 * 2 = 6 apples. Next, calculate the number of apples used by Jill for baking pies. Since she bakes 2 pies and each pie uses 10 apples, the total apples used for baking is 10 * 2 = 20 apples. Now, subtract the apples used by the kids and for baking from the original total to find how many apples are left. So, 50 - 6 - 20 = 24 apples remain.

Each year Dani gets 4 pairs of two pants each as pay winning the best Amazon buyer of the season. If he initially had 50 pants, calculate the number of pants he'll have in 5 years.
Answer:
90
Response:
<think>
Every year, Dani gets 4 pairs of pants, which means he gets 4 * 2 = 8 pants each year. Over 5 years, he will receive 8 * 5 = 40 pants. If he initially had 50 pants, then after 5 years, Dani will have 50 + 40 = 90 pants.

-------------------- Question:
Jessica’s class is going to a farm for a field trip. The school will bring all 35 students in the class plus 4 adult chaperones. The farm entrance fee for students costs $5 and $6 for adults. How much will the school pay for the farm entrance in all?
Answer:
199
Response:
<think>
To find the total entrance cost, we need to calculate the cost for both the students and the adults, and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the total cost for students:
   - Number of students: 35
   - Cost per student: $5
   - Total cost for students: \(35 \times 5 = 175\)

2. Calculate the total cost for adults:
   - Number of adults: 4
   - Cost per adult: $6
   - Total cost for adults: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

3. Add the total cost for students and adults to get the final amount:
   - Total cost for students: $175
   - Total cost for adults: $24
   - Total cost: \(175 + 24 = 199\)

</think>
<answer>
The school will pay $199 for the farm entrance in all.

-------------------- Question:
Ellen is baking bread. It takes 3 hours to rise 1 ball of dough, and then another 2 hours to bake it. If she makes 4 balls of dough one after another and then bakes them one after another when they're done rising, how many hours will it take?
Answer:
20
Response:
<think>
For each ball of dough, the total time to rise and then bake is 3 hours rising + 2 hours baking = 5 hours total per ball. Ellen makes 4 balls one after another, so the rising time for each successive ball will overlap with the baking time of the previous one.

The first ball takes 5 hours (3 for rising and 2 for baking). The second ball starts rising right after the first one is baked, so it starts rising after 5 hours, and will be ready after another 5 hours, but will start baking right when the first one is done (after 5 hours total so far).

Following this pattern, each subsequent ball of dough will add another 5 hours to the total time until the last one is baked. Therefore, for 4 balls, the total time is 5 hours for the first ball plus 3 additional sets of 5 hours for the remaining balls.

So, the total time is: 5 (first ball) + 3 * 5 (remaining balls) = 5 + 15 = 20 hours.
