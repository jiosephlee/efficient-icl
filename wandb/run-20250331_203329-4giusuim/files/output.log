Answer:
476
Response 0:
First, calculate the number of tickets that qualify for the discount. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, so the number of tickets that exceed 10 is:

\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the discount per ticket for these 2 tickets. The discount is 5% of the ticket price:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$40 = \frac{5}{100} \times 40 = \$2 \]

This means each of these 2 tickets has a discount of $2. Therefore, the discounted price for each of these 2 tickets is:

\[ \$40 - \$2 = \$38 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for the 12 tickets. The cost for the first 10 tickets is:

\[ 10 \times 40 = \$400 \]

The cost for the remaining 2 tickets is:

\[ 2 \times 38 = \$76 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount Mr. Benson paid:

\[ 400 + 76 = 476 \]

So, the total amount Mr. Benson paid is:

\[
\boxed{476}
\]
Response 1:
First, calculate the cost of the initial 10 tickets:
\[ 10 \text{ tickets} \times \$40 \text{ per ticket} = \$400 \]

Next, determine how many tickets receive the discount:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Calculate the discount for each of these 2 tickets:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$40 = 0.05 \times \$40 = \$2 \]

So the cost per discounted ticket is:
\[ \$40 - \$2 = \$38 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for the 2 discounted tickets:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$38 \text{ per ticket} = \$76 \]

Finally, add the cost of the 10 non-discounted tickets and the 2 discounted tickets to get the total amount Mr. Benson paid:
\[ \$400 + \$76 = \$476 \]

Thus, the total amount Mr. Benson paid is:
\[ \boxed{476} \]

A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer?', 'role': 'user'}]
Answer:
1500
Response 0:
To find out how much more Jane would pay in monthly installments for the house compared to the trailer, we need to calculate the monthly payments for both the house and the trailer. The calculations assume the same interest rate and loan terms for simplicity.

Given:
- House cost: $480,000
- Trailer cost: $120,000
- Loan term: 20 years (240 months)

Let's assume the interest rate is \( r \). The monthly payment \( M \) for a loan amount \( P \) over \( n \) months with an interest rate \( r \) per month can be calculated using the formula for an amortizing loan:
\[
M = P \cdot \frac{r (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Since the exact interest rate is not provided, we will demonstrate the calculation method for both the house and the trailer using a hypothetical interest rate.

### Calculation for the House

1. **Loan amount for the house**: $480,000
2. **Number of months**: 240

Using a hypothetical interest rate \( r \), we can calculate the monthly payment \( M_h \) for the house:
\[
M_h = 480,000 \cdot \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1}
\]

### Calculation for the Trailer

1. **Loan amount for the trailer**: $120,000
2. **Number of months**: 240

Using the same hypothetical interest rate \( r \), we can calculate the monthly payment \( M_t \) for the trailer:
\[
M_t = 120,000 \cdot \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1}
\]

### Difference in Monthly Payments

The difference in monthly payments between the house and the trailer is:
\[
\Delta M = M_h - M_t
\]

Substituting the formulas for \( M_h \) and \( M_t \):
\[
\Delta M = \left(480,000 \cdot \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1}\right) - \left(120,000 \cdot \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1}\right)
\]

Factor out the common term:
\[
\Delta M = \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1} \left(480,000 - 120,000\right)
\]
\[
\Delta M = \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1} \cdot 360,000
\]

Without the specific interest rate, we can simplify this to:
\[
\Delta M = 360,000 \cdot \frac{r (1 + r)^{240}}{(1 + r)^{240} - 1}
\]

If we assume a reasonable interest rate, say \( r = 0.05 \) (5% per year or 0.004167 per month), we can approximate the difference.

Using approximate calculations:
\[
\Delta M \approx 360,000 \cdot \frac{0.004167 (1 + 0.004167)^{240}}{(1 + 0.004167)^{240} - 1} \approx 360,000 \cdot 0.005 = 1800
\]

Thus, the monthly payment on the house is approximately $1800 more than the monthly payment on the trailer.

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]
Response 1:
To determine how much more the monthly payment is on the house compared to the trailer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the costs and the loan period:**
   - House cost: $480,000
   - Trailer cost: $120,000
   - Loan period: 20 years (240 months)

2. **Calculate the monthly payment for each loan:**

   We will use the formula for the monthly payment on a fixed-rate mortgage:
   \[
   M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
   \]
   where:
   - \( M \) is the monthly payment
   - \( P \) is the principal loan amount
   - \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)
   - \( n \) is the number of payments (loan term in months)

   For simplicity, let's assume an annual interest rate of 5% (0.05).

   **House:**
   - Principal (\( P \)) = $480,000
   - Monthly interest rate (\( r \)) = 0.05 / 12 = 0.004167
   - Number of payments (\( n \)) = 240

   Plugging these values into the formula:
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = \frac{480,000 \cdot 0.004167 \cdot (1 + 0.004167)^{240}}{(1 + 0.004167)^{240} - 1}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = \frac{480,000 \cdot 0.004167 \cdot 2.7126}{2.7126 - 1}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = \frac{480,000 \cdot 0.01144}{1.7126}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} = \frac{5,491.2}{1.7126}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{house}} \approx 3,209.06
   \]

   **Trailer:**
   - Principal (\( P \)) = $120,000
   - Monthly interest rate (\( r \)) = 0.05 / 12 = 0.004167
   - Number of payments (\( n \)) = 240

   Plugging these values into the formula:
   \[
   M_{\text{trailer}} = \frac{120,000 \cdot 0.004167 \cdot (1 + 0.004167)^{240}}{(1 + 0.004167)^{240} - 1}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{trailer}} = \frac{120,000 \cdot 0.004167 \cdot 2.7126}{2.7126 - 1}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{trailer}} = \frac{120,000 \cdot 0.01144}{1.7126}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{trailer}} = \frac{1,372.8}{1.7126}
   \]
   \[
   M_{\text{trailer}} \approx 801.46
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in monthly payments:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = M_{\text{house}} - M_{\text{trailer}} = 3,209.06 - 801.46 = 2,407.60
   \]

Therefore, the monthly payment on the house is approximately $2,407.60 more than

Answer:
1040
Response 0:
First, calculate the weekly cost for the clarinet lessons:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/week} = 120 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, calculate the weekly cost for the piano lessons:
\[ 28 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now find the difference in weekly cost between the piano and clarinet lessons:
\[ 140 \text{ dollars/week} - 120 \text{ dollars/week} = 20 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To find the annual difference, multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 20 \text{ dollars/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 1040 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, Janet spends \(\boxed{1040}\) dollars more on piano lessons than clarinet lessons in a year.
Response 1:
First, calculate the weekly cost for each type of lesson.

For clarinet lessons:
- Janet pays $40 per hour.
- She takes 3 hours per week.

The weekly cost for clarinet lessons is:
\[ 40 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{dollars} \]

For piano lessons:
- Janet pays $28 per hour.
- She takes 5 hours per week.

The weekly cost for piano lessons is:
\[ 28 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate the annual cost for each type of lesson by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks).

For clarinet lessons:
\[ 120 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks} = 6240 \, \text{dollars} \]

For piano lessons:
\[ 140 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks} = 7280 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, find the difference between the annual cost of piano lessons and the annual cost of clarinet lessons:
\[ 7280 \, \text{dollars} - 6240 \, \text{dollars} = 1040 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Janet spends \(\boxed{1040}\) dollars more on piano lessons than on clarinet lessons in a year.

She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. If she needs 12 basil leaves, how many leaves total does she need?', 'role': 'user'}]
Answer:
29
Response 0:
We start by defining the number of each type of leaf in terms of the number of verbena leaves. Let's denote the number of verbena leaves as \( v \).

According to the problem, Sabrina needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. Therefore, the number of sage leaves \( s \) can be expressed as:
\[ s = v - 5 \]

Additionally, Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves. Since she needs 12 basil leaves, we can write:
\[ 12 = 2s \]

We can solve for \( s \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ s = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Now that we know the number of sage leaves \( s = 6 \), we can find the number of verbena leaves \( v \) using the relationship:
\[ s = v - 5 \]
\[ 6 = v - 5 \]
\[ v = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

So, Sabrina needs 11 verbena leaves, 6 sage leaves, and 12 basil leaves. To find the total number of leaves, we sum these amounts:
\[ 11 + 6 + 12 = 29 \]

Thus, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]
Response 1:
Let's start by defining the number of each type of herb Sabrina needs. Let \( B \) be the number of basil leaves, \( S \) be the number of sage leaves, and \( V \) be the number of verbena leaves.

From the problem, we know that Sabrina needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 2S \]
We are given that she needs 12 basil leaves, so:
\[ 12 = 2S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ S = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Next, we know that she needs 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves. This can be expressed as:
\[ S = V - 5 \]
Since we know \( S = 6 \), we can substitute this value in:
\[ 6 = V - 5 \]
Solving for \( V \), we get:
\[ V = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now we know the number of each type of leaf:
- Basil leaves \( B = 12 \)
- Sage leaves \( S = 6 \)
- Verbena leaves \( V = 11 \)

To find the total number of leaves, we sum these values:
\[ B + S + V = 12 + 6 + 11 = 29 \]

Thus, the total number of leaves Sabrina needs is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]

Answer:
84
Response 0:
To find the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum up all the temperatures for the past 5 years.
2. Divide the sum by the number of years (which is 5).

The temperatures for the past 5 years are:
- 2020: 90 degrees
- 2019: 90 degrees
- 2018: 90 degrees
- 2017: 79 degrees
- 2016: 71 degrees

First, we sum these temperatures:
\[ 90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 = 4 wildlife initialization

Next, we divide the sum by the number of years (5):
\[ \frac{420}{5} = 84 \]

So, the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years is \(\boxed{84}\).
Response 1:

The temperatures for the past 5 years are:
2020: 90 degrees
2019: 90 degrees
2018: 90 degrees
2017: 79 degrees
2016: 71 degrees

First, we sum these temperatures:
\[ 90 + 90 + 90 + 79 + 71 \]

Adding them step-by-step:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]
\[ 180 + 90 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 79 = 349 \]
\[ 349 + 71 = 420 \]

So, the total sum of the temperatures is 420 degrees.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of years (5):
\[ \frac{420}{5} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average temperature for July 4th in Washington, DC over the past 5 years is \(\boxed{84}\) degrees.

Answer:
328
Response 0:
First, we calculate the reading speed of each individual in pages per minute.

- Rene's reading speed: \( \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \)
- Lulu's reading speed: \( \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \)
- Cherry's reading speed: \( \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \)

Next, we determine how many pages each person can read in 240 minutes.

- Pages Rene can read in 240 minutes: \( 0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages} \)
- Pages Lulu can read in 240 minutes: \( 0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages} \)
- Pages Cherry can read in 240 minutes: \( 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ pages} \)

Finally, we sum the pages read by each person to get the total number of pages read.

Total pages read = \( 120 + 108 + 100 = 328 \text{ pages} \)

So, the total number of pages they have finished reading in 240 minutes is \(\boxed{328}\).
Response 1:
To determine the total number of pages read by Rene, Lulu, and Cherry in 240 minutes, we first need to find out how many pages each of them can read in one minute and then multiply by the total time they have been reading.

First, we calculate the reading speed for each person in pages per minute:
- Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes, so her reading speed is:
  \[
  \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute}
  \]
- Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes, so her reading speed is:
  \[
  \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute}
  \]
- Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes, so her reading speed is:
  \[
  \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{25}{60} = \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages each person reads in 240 minutes:
- Rene reads:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages}
  \]
- Lulu reads:
  \[
  0.45 \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages}
  \]
- Cherry reads:
  \[
  \frac{5}{12} \text{ pages per minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ pages}
  \]

Finally, we add the pages read by each person to find the total number of pages read:
\[
120 + 108 + 100 = 328
\]

Thus, the total number of pages they have finished reading in 240 minutes is \(\boxed{328}\).

Answer:
36
Response 0:
Let's denote the number of times Martin rings the big bell as \( B \). According to the problem, he rings the small bell \( \frac{1}{3}B + 4 \) times. The total number of times he rings both bells is 52. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + \left( \frac{1}{3}B + 4 \right) = 52 \]

First, we combine like terms:

\[ B + \frac{1}{3}B + 4 = 52 \]

Next, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms involving \( B \):

\[ B + \frac{1}{3}B = 48 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \( B \) and \( \frac{1}{3}B \) is 3, so we rewrite \( B \) as \( \frac{3}{3}B \):

\[ \frac{3}{3}B + \frac{1}{3}B = 48 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{4}{3}B = 48 \]

To solve for \( B \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{4}{3} \), which is \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[ B = 48 \cdot \frac{3}{4} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ B = 36 \]

So, Martin rings the big bell \( \boxed{36} \) times.
Response 1:
Let's define the number of times Martin rings the big bell as \( B \). According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than \(\frac{1}{3}\) as often as the big bell. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of times the small bell is rung} = \frac{B}{3} + 4 \]

The total number of times both bells are rung is 52. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ B + \left(\frac{B}{3} + 4\right) = 52 \]

First, simplify inside the parentheses:
\[ B + \frac{B}{3} + 4 = 52 \]

Next, isolate the terms involving \( B \):
\[ B + \frac{B}{3} = 52 - 4 \]
\[ B + \frac{B}{3} = 48 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{3B + B}{3} = 48 \]
\[ \frac{4B}{3} = 48 \]

Now, solve for \( B \) by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 4B = 144 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:
\[ B = 36 \]

So, Martin rings the big bell \(\boxed{36}\) times.

Answer:
75
Response 0:
To find the average number of words in each crossword puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of crossword puzzles Bert fills out in two weeks.
2. Use the information that Bert uses up a pencil after filling out this number of puzzles to find the average number of words per puzzle.

First, let's find out how many days there are in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Since Bert fills out one puzzle each day, the total number of puzzles he fills out in two weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ puzzles} \]

We know that Bert uses up a pencil after filling out these 14 puzzles, and it takes 1050 words to use up a pencil. Therefore, the average number of words per puzzle is:
\[ \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ puzzles}} = 75 \text{ words/puzzle} \]

So, the average number of words in each crossword puzzle is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]
Response 1:
First, determine how many crosswords Bert completes in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, in two weeks there are \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, Bert completes 14 crossword puzzles in two weeks.

Next, we know that it takes Bert 1050 words to fill out a pencil in two weeks. Since this is the total number of words used to complete 14 crosswords, we can find the average number of words per crossword by dividing the total number of words by the number of crosswords:

\[
\text{Average number of words per crossword} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ crosswords}} = 75 \text{ words}
\]

Thus, the average number of words in each crossword puzzle is \(\boxed{75}\).

He uses 4 bags of flour each weighing 5 pounds.  If Jim eats 15 cookies how many cookies are left?', 'role': 'user'}]
Answer:
105
Response 0:
First, let's determine how many cookies Matt can make with the flour he has. Matt can make 12 cookies with 2 pounds of flour. He has 4 bags of flour, each weighing 5 pounds, so he has a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) pounds of flour.

Next, we calculate how many dozen cookies he can make with 20 pounds of flour. Since 2 pounds of flour make 12 cookies, 20 pounds of flour will make \(\frac{20}{2} \times 12 = 10 \times 12 = 120\) cookies.

Now, we need to determine how many cookies are left after Jim eats 15 cookies. If Matt made 120 cookies and Jim eats 15, then the number of cookies left is \(120 - 15 = 105\).

So, the number of cookies left is \(\boxed{105}\).
Response 1:
First, we determine how many cookies Matt can make with the flour he has. Since he can make 12 cookies with 2 pounds of flour, we calculate the number of cookies per pound:
\[ \text{Cookies per pound} = \frac{12 \text{ cookies}}{2 \text{ pounds}} = 6 \text{ cookies per pound} \]

Next, we find out how much flour Matt has in total:
\[ \text{Total flour} = 4 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bag} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Matt can make with 20 pounds of flour:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 20 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pound} = 120 \text{ cookies} \]

If Jim eats 15 cookies, we subtract that from the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies left} = 120 \text{ cookies} - 15 \text{ cookies} = 105 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies left is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]

Answer:
50
Response 0:
On the first day, James collects 50 tins.

On the second day, he collects \(3 \times 50 = 150\) tins.

On the third day, he collects \(150 - 50 = 100\) tins.

So far, James has collected \(50 + 150 + 100 = 300\) tins in the first three days.

He aims to collect a total of 500 tins in a week. Therefore, the number of tins he still needs to collect is \(500 - 300 = 200\) tins.

Since he has 4 days left in the week and he needs to collect the remaining 200 tins equally over these days, he needs to collect \(200 \div 4 = 50\) tins each day for the rest of the week.

Thus, the number of tins he collects each day for the rest of the week is \(\boxed{50}\).
Response 1:
Let's calculate the number of tins James collects each day and then determine how many he needs to collect for the rest of the week.

First, we know the number of tins collected on the first day:
\[ \text{Day 1: } 50 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we know the number of tins collected on the second day, which is 3 times the number collected on the first day:
\[ \text{Day 2: } 3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ tins} \]

Then, we know the number of tins collected on the third day, which is 50 tins fewer than the number collected on the second day:
\[ \text{Day 3: } 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ tins} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of tins collected in the first three days:
\[ \text{Total for the first three days} = 50 + 150 + 100 = 300 \text{ tins} \]

Since the total number of tins James needs to collect in the week is 500, we find out how many tins he still needs to collect:
\[ 500 - 300 = 200 \text{ tins} \]

These remaining tins need to be collected over the next 4 days of the week, and since he collects an equal number of tins each day, we divide the remaining tins by 4:
\[ \frac{200}{4} = 50 \text{ tins per day} \]

Thus, the number of tins James collects each day for the rest of the week is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]

If there are 200 jellybeans in the jar, how many are there of the red color?', 'role': 'user'}]
Answer:
120
Response 0:
To find out how many red jellybeans are in the jar, we first need to determine the total number of jellybeans that are not red. We know the jar has a total of 200 jellybeans, and the counts for blue, purple, and orange jellybeans are given. We can add the number of blue, purple, and orange jellybeans together to find the total number of non-red jellybeans.

The number of blue jellybeans is 14.
The number of purple jellybeans is 26.
The number of orange jellybeans is 40.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 14 + 26 + 40 = 80 \]

So, there are 80 jellybeans that are not red. To find the number of red jellybeans, we subtract the number of non-red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans in the jar.

The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Thus, the number of red jellybeans is \(\boxed{120}\).
Response 1:
To determine the number of red jellybeans in the jar, we start by calculating the total number of jellybeans that are not red. According to the problem, the jar contains 14 blue, 26 purple, and 40 orange jellybeans. We can find the total number of these colored jellybeans by adding these quantities together:

\[
14 + 26 + 40 = 80
\]

This means there are 80 jellybeans that are either blue, purple, or orange. Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 200, the number of red jellybeans can be found by subtracting the number of non-red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Thus, the number of red jellybeans is

\[
\boxed{120}
\]

The total cost of their trip is $76. If each child's ticket is $7, how much, in dollars, are the adult tickets?", 'role': 'user'}]
Answer:
10
Response 0:
Let's denote the cost of one adult ticket as \( A \) dollars. We know the following:

1. The total cost of the trip is $76.
2. The cost of concessions is $12.
3. The cost of one child's ticket is $7.

First, we need to find out how much the movie tickets cost in total. Since the total cost is $76 and the concessions cost $12, the cost of the movie tickets is:
\[ 76 - 12 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

This $64 is the total cost of 5 adult tickets and 2 child tickets. We know each child's ticket costs $7, so the total cost of the children's tickets is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost of the adult tickets is:
\[ 64 - 14 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Since this $50 is the total cost of 5 adult tickets, the cost of one adult ticket is:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost of each adult ticket is \(\boxed{10}\).
Response 1:
Let the cost of one adult ticket be \( A \) dollars. The cost of one child's ticket is $7. There are 5 adults and 2 children, and the total cost of the tickets and concessions is $76. The concessions cost $12. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets alone is $76 - $12 = $64. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ 5A + 2 \cdot 7 = 64 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 5A + 14 = 64 \]

Next, isolate the term with \( A \) by subtracting 14 from both sides:

\[ 5A = 64 - 14 \]
\[ 5A = 50 \]

Now, solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides by 5:

\[ A = \frac{50}{5} \]
\[ A = 10 \]

So, the cost of each adult ticket is \(\boxed{10}\) dollars.

Answer:
72
Response 0:
First, we calculate the total number of blue marbles Janelle bought. Since she bought 6 bags and each bag contains 10 marbles, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

So, Janelle has 60 blue marbles after buying the bags. Next, we need to account for the marbles she gave to her friend. She gave away 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles. We subtract these from her original counts:

The number of green marbles left is:
\[ 26 - 6 = 20 \]

The number of blue marbles left is:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Now we add the remaining green and blue marbles to find the total number of marbles Janelle has now:
\[ 20 + 52 = 72 \]

So, the total number of marbles Janelle has now is:
\[
\boxed{72}
\]
Response 1:
First, we calculate the total number of blue marbles Janelle bought. Since she bought 6 bags and each bag contains 10 marbles, the total number of blue marbles is:
\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \]

Next, we determine the total number of marbles Janelle had before giving the gift. She initially had 26 green marbles and 60 blue marbles, so:
\[ 26 + 60 = 86 \]

Janelle then gave a gift of 6 green marbles and 8 blue marbles to a friend. The number of green marbles left is:
\[ 26 - 6 = 20 \]
And the number of blue marbles left is:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of marbles Janelle has now is:
\[ 20 + 52 = 72 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{72}
\]

Answer:
1330
Response 0:
To determine how many pages Siena will have in her bookmarks library at the end of March, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of days in March**:
   March has 31 days.

2. **Calculate the number of days Siena bookmarks**:
   Since Siena bookmarks pages every day, she will bookmark for all 31 days in March.

3. **Determine the number of pages Siena bookmarks in March**:
   Siena bookmarks 30 pages each day.
   \[
   \text{Total pages bookmarked in March} = 30 \text{ pages/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 930 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Add the pages she has already bookmarked**:
   Siena currently has 400 pages bookmarked.
   \[
   \text{Total pages in bookmarks library at the end of March} = 400 \text{ pages} + 930 \text{ pages} = 1330 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, at the end of March, Siena will have \boxed{1330} pages in her bookmarks library.
Response 1:
To determine how many bookmarked pages Siena will have at the end of March, we first need to establish the number of days in March. March has 31 days.

Siena bookmarks 30 pages every day. Therefore, over the course of 31 days, she will bookmark:

\[
30 \text{ pages/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 930 \text{ pages}
\]

Siena currently has 400 bookmarked pages in her library. Adding the pages she will bookmark in March, we get:

\[
400 \text{ pages} + 930 \text{ pages} = 1330 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, at the end of March, Siena will have:

\[
\boxed{1330}
\]

bookmark pages in her library.

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?', 'role': 'user'}]
Answer:
1000
Response 0:
First, we determine how many gold coins will be in each chest. The pirate has 3500 gold coins and wants to distribute them equally across 5 chests. So, we perform the division:

\[ \frac{3500}{5} = 700 \]

This means each chest will have 700 gold coins.

Next, we need to find out how many silver coins will be in each chest. The pirate has a total of 500 silver coins and wants to distribute them equally across the 5 chests. So, we perform the division:

\[ \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

This means each chest will have 100 silver coins.

Now, we need to find out how many bronze coins will be in each chest. The pirate has twice as many bronze coins as silver coins, so he has:

\[ 2 \times 500 = 1000 \text{ bronze coins} \]

We then distribute these 1000 bronze coins equally across the 5 chests. So, we perform the division:

\[ \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \]

This means each chest will have 200 bronze coins.

To find the total number of coins in each chest, we sum the gold, silver, and bronze coins:

\[ 700 \text{ (gold)} + 100 \text{ (silver)} + 200 \text{ (bronze)} = 1000 \]

So, the total number of coins in each chest is:

\[ \boxed{1000} \]
Response 1:
First, let's determine how many gold coins will be in each chest. The pirate has 3500 gold coins and wants to distribute them equally across 5 chests. So, we divide the total number of gold coins by the number of chests:

\[
\frac{3500}{5} = 700
\]

This means each chest will contain 700 gold coins.

Next, let's consider the silver coins. The pirate has 500 silver coins and wants to distribute them equally across the 5 chests. So, we divide the total number of silver coins by the number of chests:

\[
\frac{500}{5} = 100
\]

This means each chest will contain 100 silver coins.

Now, let's consider the bronze coins. The pirate has twice as many bronze coins as silver coins. Since he has 500 silver coins, he will have:

\[
2 \times 500 = 1000
\]

bronze coins. These bronze coins will be distributed equally across the 5 chests. So, we divide the total number of bronze coins by the number of chests:

\[
\frac{1000}{5} = 200
\]

This means each chest will contain 200 bronze coins.

To find the total number of coins in each chest, we add the number of gold coins, silver coins, and bronze coins in each chest:

\[
700 + 100 + 200 = 1000
\]

Thus, each chest will contain \(\boxed{1000}\) coins in total.

Answer:
153
Response 0:
The second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine, so we calculate the number of necklaces made by the second machine as follows:

\[ 2.4 \times 45 = 108 \]

This means the second machine made 108 necklaces. To find the total number of necklaces made by both machines on Sunday, we add the number of necklaces made by the first machine to the number made by the second machine:

\[ 45 + 108 = 153 \]

Therefore, the total number of necklaces made on Sunday is:

\[
\boxed{153}
\]
Response 1:
First, let's determine how many necklaces the second machine made. According to the problem, the second machine made 2.4 times as many necklaces as the first machine. Since the first machine made 45 necklaces, we can calculate the number of necklaces made by the second machine as follows:

\[ \text{Number of necklaces made by the second machine} = 45 \times 2.4 \]

To find the product, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 45 \times 2.4 = 45 \times \left(2 + 0.4\right) = (45 \times 2) + (45 \times 0.4) \]
\[ 45 \times 2 = 90 \]
\[ 45 \times 0.4 = 18 \]
\[ 90 + 18 = 108 \]

So, the second machine made 108 necklaces. Now, we need to find the total number of necklaces made by both machines. We add the number of necklaces made by the first machine to the number of necklaces made by the second machine:

\[ \text{Total number of necklaces} = 45 + 108 = 153 \]

Thus, the total number of necklaces made on Sunday is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]

Answer:
92
Response 0:
On Tuesday, Zach baked half the amount he baked on Monday, so he baked 32 / 2 = <<32/2=16>>16 cookies.
On Wednesday, he baked three times the amount he baked on Tuesday, so he baked 16 * 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 cookies.
His brother ate 4 of those cookies, so he had 48 - 4 = <<48-4=44>>44 cookies on Wednesday.
In total, Zach had 32 + 16 + 44 = <<32+16+44=92>>92 cookies.

Therefore, the answer is 92.
Response 1:
On Tuesday, Zach baked half the amount of cookies he did on Monday, which is 32 / 2 = 16 cookies.
On Wednesday, he baked 3 x the number of cookies he did on Tuesday, which is 3 * 16 = 48 cookies.
Zach’s brother ate 4 of the cookies from Wednesday’s batch, so he had 48 - 4 = 44 cookies.
Zach baked a total of 32 + 16 + 44 = 92 cookies over the 3 days.

Therefore, the total number of cookies Zach had at the end of the three days is 92.
